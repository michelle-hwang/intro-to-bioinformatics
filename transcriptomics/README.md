# Transcriptomics 
1. Assembly and Assessment
2. Abundance Estimation and Annotation 
3. Differential Expression Analysis

### Objectives
* To understand the differences between de novo and reference based assembly
* To discuss the different strategies to assess assembly quality
* To understand and execute normalization techniques for RNA-Seq data
* To perform/practice an entire transcriptome study on RNA-Seq data

## Assembly and Assessment

### Session 01 - Lecture
1. Pre-Class Reading 
2. In-Class Readiness Assurance Process
3. Introduce topic of next lab session: students will all assemble a yeast transcriptome using the same methodology. However, to assess the assembly quality, each student in a group will be assigned a different asssessment strategy to use on his/her assembly. 
  * Discuss with groups criteria to look for
  * Assign strategies A, B and C

### Session 02 - Lab
1. Work on lab with in group of the same strategies: group A, group B, and group C.
2. Discuss with strategy group the pros/cons of strategy.
3. Meet back with original team and report on individual strategies.
4. Evaluate and rank strategies based on given criteria.
