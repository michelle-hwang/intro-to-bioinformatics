Statistic | Description 
--- | --- 
**Audience** | Upper level undergraduate students, entry level graduate students in the life sciences
**Prior Experience** | Prior experience in programming unnecessary

We are at the start of a digital age, in which technology is advancing rapidly and becoming an integral part of our daily lives and careers. Not only will computational skills be valuable, but they will become necessary to stay ahead, especially in the scientific field. All students, no matter the career path, should understand basic computational and programming skills. Additionally, since these skills can be largely self-taught, students should be comfortable with exploring more advanced strategies applicable to his or her work and adapt them. 

## Objectives
Broadly, students should be able to:

* Adapt skills and concepts taught in class to new problems and challenges
* Communicate effectively at the interface of technology/computer science and biology (or other non-technical field)
* Comfortably navigate tools and software used in class unsupervised when presented with a new task
* Be inspired to be more inquisitive and seek more knowledge in the topic

By the end of this course, students will know/understand:

* How a computer and a computer cluster works conceptually
* What the latest next-generation sequencing technologies are
* What analyses are available for sequencing data
* What scientific data is publicly available and where to get it

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

* Work on a Linux-based command line interface 
* Submit computing jobs to a high computing cluster using TORQUE scheduling manager (or whichever manager the HPC uses that the students have access to, i.e. Sapelo or zcluster at UGA)
* Write simple data “plumbing” scripts in Python
* Run basic statistical analyses in R  
* Find manuals for packages and modules that can be used in R and Python online and import and use them in scripts
